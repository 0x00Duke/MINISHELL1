# MINISHELL1
You have to program a UNIX command interpreter.
The interpreter is expected to display a prompt ($> for example) and then wait for you to write a command line.

You must correctly handle the PATH and the environment (by copying and restoring the initial env).
You must implement the following builtins : cd, setenv, unsetenv, env, exit.

You can try the project by running this commands:

      "make" and then "./mysh"
